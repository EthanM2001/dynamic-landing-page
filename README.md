# Dynamic Landing Page

After reading a few articles on the internet about projects I should build for _my portfolio_, I came across a dynamic landing page... At the time I wasn't quite sure what one actually was, so I decided to search youtube, reddit and many articles online, including http://medium.com

After having understood what a landing page was, I decided to make a template in http://figma.com in order to design what I wanted my final product to look like.

When creating this project, I decided to create it with HTML and JS instead of react as I could do everything I needed to do without react so I thought, there's no point using a library that's slightly more complicated to use when I could use HTML and still make my code readable. To style, I used CSS as there was not a lot of styling to do so I used the styling that I have used before.

I used a weather api for this project, http://openweathermap.org. I have used this api breifly in the past during my bootcamp course, I briefly remembered how to use the api however a quick look through the doumentation beforehand didn't hurt.
